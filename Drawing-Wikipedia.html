 <p><h3><b>Paper<b></h3></p>
 <p>Paper <u>originated from China</u> during the <u>Eastern Han period</u>.<p>

<p> Before it was made, people used <b> turtle shells</b> , rocks or bamboo. </p>
<p>This were either hard to write on or too expensive imagine if you were supposed to sent letters back and forth it would be very heavy, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>The reason for its fame is that paper was easy to write on, light and inexpensive. The paper is made by making old rags, mulberry, hem waste, fishing rags or bast fibres into a pulp which in laid out and dried to make paper. All these made paper light and inexpensive. </p>
