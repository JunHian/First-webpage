    <p><u>What does the bacteriophages look like?</u></p>
    <p>Bacteriophages have <u>icosahedron</u> which is hexagonal which has 20 faces and 30 edges similar to a dice and contains the viruses DNA, <u>collar core</u> which connects the head with the helical sheath, <u>helical sheath</u> where the DNA will pass through, <u>tail spike</u> which injects its DNA into the host, <u>hexagonal base plate</u> where the spike and sheath is connected and <u>fiber legs</u> to move around.</p>  

    <p><u>What are Bacteriophages?</u></p>

    <p>Bacteriophages refers to <u>bacteria devourer.</u> Because of the "bacterio" similar to bacteria and the greek word "phagein" which means devour. They exist everywhere even inside your bodies right now! Do you know there are more pages than every other organisms in the world which includes viruses.</p>

    <p>Bacteriophages are viruses target specific bacteria. After they find their victim, they <u>inject their own DNA</u> into the host of <u>certain type of bacteria</u>, <u>which forces them to make more of the bacteriophages</u> and later gushes out all of the bacteriophages within them due to the enzymes they have produce which creates hold allowing the bacteriophages to escape.</p>
    <p><u>Should we be afraid of them?</u></p>

    <p>Well not really since they <u>only target specific bacteria</u> and they also help to kill <u>almost 40% of the bacteria from the ocean everyday.</u></p>

    <p><u>Medical Discovery</u></p>

    <p>Let us look at the history long before medicine was created</p>

    <p>Long before the first medicine was created, if you gotten a cut it was likely to be <u>fatal</u> you can even say that bacteria was our phages during that time.</p>

    <p>Then the first ever accidental medical <u>groundbreaking discovery</u> that could cure save lives was created an antibiotic called "penicillin". Suddenly bactera was no longer our phages due to its effectiveness. Lesser people died most of those who died were the weak and old.</p>
    <p><u>Antibiotic Resistance</u></p>

    <p>We were <u>so dependent on the antibiotics</u> that we use it for less serious cases such as a cold or cough to the point we were caught off guard by the evolved bacteria called "superbugs".</p>

    <p>Superbugs is <u>one of the leading cause of death</u> even more than some types of cancer. Superbugs is a <u>highly antibiotics resistant</u> bacteria or virus to the point that most types of medication do not work on them</p>

    <p>There was such case where a man was suffering from a severe superbug infection to the point where alochol was unable to kill it which doctors said that he had no hope left so they had tried to give him a type of bacteriophage and some anitbiotics which the bacteria was immune after a week he recovered from it</p>

    <p>Antibiotics vs Bacteriophages</p>
    <p>What happens if the bacteria become <u>immune</u> to bacteriophage?</p>
    <p>Antibiotics <u>kill both the good and bad bacteria</u> however since the bacteriophages target certain types of bacteria it <u>does not harm the good bacteria or the human cell</u> similar to a homing missile.
    <p>So what happend when the bacteria <u>becomes resistant</u> to the bacteriophage? Well when they become resistant to the bacteriophage they also have the give up their resistance to antibiotic so its a double edged sword.</p>
